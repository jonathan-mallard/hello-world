# hello-world
This is my first repository
I am a husband and dad of three small kids.  I have wanted to learn how to program for several years now, but have always come up with excuses why I didn't have the time to do it.  Considering that we are in the heart of quarantine for COVID-19, my excuse of not enough time is gone.  Time to quit making excuses and start making connections and, potentially, a new career path.
